The structure below the former front window was crumbling onto the sidewalk. A board was ripped out and lying in front of it, covered in broken glass. A new board covered only part of the window. In February, more than a year after being found in compliance, the property was cited for nine code violations. A hearing is scheduled for mid-June. </span></div>
