<div class='captionheader'>2116 TUPELO ST | Lower 9th Ward</div><div class='captionsection'>History:  <span class='grey'>Demolition 8/27/2013</span></div><div class='captionsection'>Notes: <span class='grey'>The former home was ordered demolished by the city after inspectors found it abandoned, gutted and unsecured. The remaining lot may be an improvement, but it is significantly overgrown. A city employee's demolition follow-up photo, taken in March, actually shows 2120 Tupelo, which is in better shape. Owner owed nearly $37,000 in back property taxes and code liens on the property as of June. </span></div>
